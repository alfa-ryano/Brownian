    <h1><span style="color: #cc0000;">Instruction for Problem 02</span></h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In this problem, the investor has a fund of
      <strong><span style="color: red;">[portfolio]</span></strong> ECU, and
      he/she entrusts you to manage his/her funds. You only have two types of
      the market, the money market and the asset market, to invest the funds.
      The money market gives you a constant interest rate of <strong><span style="color: red;">[interest]</span><span

          style="color: red;"> </span></strong>percent to the maturity time,
      whereas the asset market trades assets continuously in time. You will have
      <strong style="color: red;">[period/60]</strong> minute(s) to complete
      this problem. The initial price in the asset market is <strong style="color: red;">[price]</strong>
      ECU per unit asset. You will have to notice that the asset price will
      change every 0.1 second continuously.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The investor has his/her own strategy if
      he/she manages his/her fund by himself/herself. He/she would allocate some
      of the funds in each market in the beginning and lets the portfolio grows
      until the maturity period. Here, the investor would allocate <strong style="color: red;">[b_asset]</strong>
      percent of the funds in the asset market - that is <strong style="color: red;">[1 - b_asset]</strong> percent of the funds allocated in the money market.
      Of course, this portfolio fluctuates over an investment period and will be
      the benchmark by the maturity period.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Given this information, you are asked if you
      can manage the funds better than that of the investor's benchmark. This
      will determine your compensation. If you can perform better than that of
      the investor benchmark by the maturity period, you will earn more
      compensation.</p>
    <h2>Your Compensation</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will receive compensation by managing
      the investor's funds. There are two types of compensation, the fixed
      compensation and the additional compensation. The fixed compensation is <strong

        style="color: red;">[fixed_comp]</strong> ECU and will be paid to you
      independently of your performance. The additional compensation is <strong

        style="color: red;">[add_comp]</strong> percent of positive profit that
      you have made from your final portfolio minus the final benchmark
      portfolio. So you will earn more compensation if your final portfolio is
      higher than that of the final benchmark portfolio.</p>
