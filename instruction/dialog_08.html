    <h1 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Initial Allocation for Problem 08</h1>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">You have to set your initial investment
      allocation in both money market and asset market. You can do so by
      changing the value in the "<strong>Initial Allocation in the Stock Market</strong>"
      box below - that is in percentage value. That determines your initial
      allocation of the initial fund in the stock market. For example, if you
      leave the box as default <strong style="color: red;">(50.00 percent)</strong>
      that means you allocate <strong style="color: red;">50 percent</strong>
      of the initial fund in the money market and <strong><span style="color: red;">50
          percent</span></strong> of the initial fund in the asset market. If
      you put <strong style="color: red;">10.00 percent</strong> in the box,
      that means you allocate <strong style="color: red;">90 percent</strong>
      of the initial fund in the money market and <strong style="color: red;">10
        percent</strong> of the initial fund in the asset market.</div>
