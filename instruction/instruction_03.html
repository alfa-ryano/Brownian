    <p>In this problem, the investor has a fund of [portfolio] ECU, and he/she
      entrusts you to manage his/her funds. You only have two types of the
      market, the money market and the asset market, to invest the funds. The
      money market gives you a constant interest rate of [interest], whereas the
      asset market trades assets continuously in time. The initial price in the
      asset market if [price] ECU per unit asset.</p>
    <p>The investor has his/her own strategy if he/she manages his/her fund by
      himself/herself. He/she will allocate some of the funds in each market in
      the beginning and lets the portfolio grows until the maturity period.
      Here, the investor allocates [b_asset] percent of the funds in the asset
      market - that is [1 - b_asset] percent of the funds allocated in the money
      market. Of course, this portfolio fluctuates over an investment period and
      will be the benchmark by the maturity period.</p>
    <p>Given this information, you are asked if you can manage the funds better
      than that of the investor's benchmark. This will determine your
      compensation. If you can perform better than that of the investor
      benchmark by the maturity period, you will earn more compensation.</p>
    <h2>Your Compensation</h2>
    <p>You will receive compensation by managing the investor's funds. There are
      two types of compensation, the fixed compensation and the additional
      compensation. The fixed compensation is [fixed_comp] and will be paid to
      you independently of your performance. The additional compensation is
      [add_comp] percent of positive profit that you have made from your final
      portfolio minus the benchmark portfolio. So you will earn more
      compensation if your final portfolio is higher than that of the final
      benchmark.</p>
